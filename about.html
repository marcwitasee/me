        <p>I am a graduate student at the Harris School of Public Policy seeking to expand my data analytical skills with coursework in computer science, statistics, and economics. I strive to become a leader in technology policy, helping to create and implement evidence-based policies, in collaboration with the government and the private sector, to ensure disruptive new technologies indiscriminately serve the public interest. </p>
        <p>I grew up in Colorado, a place very near and dear to my heart. I attended the College of William and Mary where I majored in Economics and International Relations. I moved up to DC after graduating to work for an economic consulting company, where I applied statstical and economic analysis to antiturst and intellectual property cases. My work primarily consisted of consulting on cases involving patent infringement in smartphones. It was through this work that I became interested in technology policy and the societal implications of how technology is used at large.</p>
        <p>I currently reside in Chicago for my graduate program. But, I spend a lot of time in Colorado, where most of my family lives. Nothing energizes me more than a beautiful day of skiing or hiking. Outdoors rock!</p>
