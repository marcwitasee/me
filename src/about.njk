        <p>At the intersection of cloud computing, edge infrastructure, and data-driven decision-making, I specialize in designing and managing large-scale technical projects that optimize performance, scalability, and impact.</p>
        <p>At the University of Chicago, I've led strategic initiatives in cloud and edge computing—building and operating infrastructure that powers broadband measurement, high-performance computing, and advanced research applications. My work has directly supported scalable cloud platforms, fleet management systems, and real-world data-driven insights, benefiting researchers, organizations, and policymakers alike.</p>
        <p>With expertise in cloud infrastructure (OpenStack, AWS), data pipelines (storage, compute, architecture), and AI-driven systems (OpenAI, Anthropic APIs), I bring a strong background in technical project leadership and cross-functional execution—bridging strategic goals with scalable cloud architectures, intelligent automation, and high-performance data platforms.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to apply my expertise in cloud infrastructure, AI systems, and scalable data solutions to fast-moving, innovation-driven environments in the tech industry.</p>
